Subject: Big bulkfoods.com order

Do you want cheap bulk foods? Shiphouse provides. Reply to me (not reply all!) and fill out the attached template with your requests before Thursday 4/23 to be included on the order.

Foods: see [1] for a full list of options. Nuts, spices, dried fruit, unusual flours. In theory I might decide not to fill orders for candy, but you can try and it will probably happen (freedom >> nutrition).

Money: there will be $5 for shipping, divided between participants proportionally to money spent. $0 will be added for shiphouse processing effort (at least for this first order, future tbd). After that, personal totals will be rounded to the nearest $0.25 (don't place an order with a budget of 12 cents; we will drop it and be sad at you). Expect to pay in cash (we use quarters for laundry, but no other coins), with no guarantee that we can provide change.

I expect that we will order 1 and 5 pound quantities of many foods, and maybe 25 pounds of very popular foods. Note that the spice bottles you're used to seeing that look like this [2] are ~1 pound of spices -- it's not as crazy an amount as you might think.

See [3] if you care about details on how quantities/prices will be determined. Tl;dr, the algorithm minimizes the maximum unit price that anyone pays (yay efficiency!), so you don't need to carefully set your unit price to perfectly match a particular bulkfood.com order size. (Perhaps instead consider your next best option for buying these foods...)

COVID: in light of the current disease terror, we will take some precautions around food processing and delivery (no "we got food!" party at shiphouse :/). We will wash hands and don masks before repackaging food, and I'll go on a long walk with a cart to deliver (probably less than my body weight in) food to everyone who lives vaguely nearby (if you're _very_ far away you may need to come to shiphouse). If you're worried about germs on surfaces then you should wear gloves while accepting the food and paying for it, then leave the food untouched in a corner of your apartment for however long you believe the virus can survive on surfaces. IMO this is plenty safe, and certainly beats shopping at a grocery store.
